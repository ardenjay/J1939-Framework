# J1939-Framework

Framework to work with J1939 protocol. 

J1939 protocol is a standard used in different systems compliant with CAN 2.0B specification.

The framework has been developed in C++ in a Linux distribution and compiled using the GNU toolchain. No dependencies are required for the compilation of any of the projects except from SocketCan compiled in the Linux Kernel.

## What can you do with J1939-Framework

- **Sniff** frames from the Can Bus compliant with J1939 protocol with BinUtils/j1939Sniffer.
- **Decode** raw J1939 data to human readable data with BinUtils/j1939Decoder.
- **Craft your own J1939 frames** and send them to the Can Bus with BinUtils/j1939Sender. The functionality can be extended with the help of bash scripts located in Scripts (some examples are listed).
- **Visualize** what is going on in the Can Bus with GUI_WEB. You will be able to craft, send and visualize the frames that are flowing in the Bus as well as visualizing graphics of their content (SPNs).
- **Discover J1939 devices** with BinUtils/j1939AddressMapper.
- **Simulation of the Address Claim Process** with BinUtils/j1939AddrClaim.
- PeakCan Support
  - Save Can frames from the Can Bus into recordings in [TRC format](https://www.peak-system.com/produktcd/Pdf/English/PEAK_CAN_TRC_File_Format.pdf) with BinUtils/TRCDumper.
  - Play Can frames from recordings in TRC format into the Can Bus with BinUtils/TRCPlayer.
  - Convert TRC files into pcap files readable by wireshark with BinUtils/TRCToCap.
- Wireshark Support
  - Dissect pcap files with wireshark and the J1939 plugin dissector (wireshark/dissector).

## Development Guide

- In CAN/ folder, a library in C++ (`libCAN.so`) with methods to generate and sniff can frames with support for `PeakCan` and `SocketCan`.
- In J1939/ folder, a library in C++ (`libJ1939.so`) is to easily manipulate J1939 frames and work with the J1939 protocol. Some features are:
	- Support of BAM protocol.
	- A factory class in charge of generating the J1939 frames.
	- A database loaded by the factory located in Database/frames.json with a list of the most used Application Layer frames (including the FMS protocol).
	- Coding/Decoding DM1 (Diagnosis), FMS1 (TTS), Request and Address Claim frames.
	- Coding/Decoding of SPNs (String, status and numeric).

## Installing and compiling

### Installation
Ubuntu 18.10 or higher
```bash

sudo apt-get install libgtest-dev protobuf-compiler libprotobuf-dev libncurses-dev libwebsockets-dev cmake
cd /usr/src/gtest
sudo env "PATH=$PATH" cmake CMakeLists.txt
sudo make
sudo cp *.a /usr/lib

cd ~/work/
git clone https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp.git
cd jsoncpp
git checkout 863aa36165acfdbaf22447f4934f5adc327692a0
cmake -DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON 
sudo make install
cd ~
```

#### In-Source Build

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ardenjay/J1939-Framework.git
$ cd J1939-Framework
$ cmake .
$ cmake --build .
$ sudo make install
```

#### Out-Source Build

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ardenjay/J1939-Framework.git
$ cd J1939-Framework
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ cmake --build .. # or just type make
$ sudo make install
```

## Usage with SocketCan

To make SocketCan available in your system, you should execute the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get install can-utils
```

To enable the drivers if they not enabled by default:

```bash
sudo modprobe can
sudo modprobe vcan
```

To generate a virtual interface for test purposes.

```bash
sudo ip link add name vcan0 type vcan
```

To test over vcan0.

```bash
./Scripts/gear_level.sh vcan0 | j1939Sender --silent --file Scripts/define_frames.j1939
candump vcan0
```
